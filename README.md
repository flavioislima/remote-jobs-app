# Remote Work - Find Remote Jobs

This app helps you find remote jobs by listing available positions from websites like Remote OK, We Work Remotely, JS Remotely, and others.

## Now Powered by Expo

The app has been fully migrated to [Expo](https://expo.dev/), making development, testing, and deployment easier across Android, iOS, and Web platforms. The codebase now uses:

- **Expo Router** for navigation (file-based routing)
- **React Native Elements** for UI components
- **Expo-compatible AdMob** for ads (if enabled)
- **AsyncStorage** for persistent state
- **Modern React patterns** (hooks, context, functional components)
- **No native dependencies for date picking** (custom cross-platform date picker)
